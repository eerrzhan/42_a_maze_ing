"""
Direction and movement definitions for the maze.

This module defines:
- Direction letters (N, E, S, W)
- Bit values used for wall masks
- Opposite direction mappings
- Movement deltas for grid navigation

This file is intentionally independent of the Maze class
and contains only static direction-related utilities.
